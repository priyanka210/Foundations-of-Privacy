# Cryptography - Homomorphic and Elgamal Encryption Examples

## Description
This repository contains implementation examples of various cryptographic algorithms, including Paillier's homomorphic encryption, a homomorphic encryption GUI, Elgamal encryption in Python, and a simplified homomorphic encryption example with a GUI. These implementations are intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the encryption techniques and their applications in secure data processing.
